# Authentication and Testing
Authentication is one of the largest concepts that we get to tackle in such a short period of time. Have you ever wondered what happens when you “log in” to a website? Well this week we get a chance to learn all about that. When a user inputs data into a **username/password** form and clicks login, what then happens to that data? How does the site the user is working with even know that the data it is showing pertains to that specific user? This all has to do with what we call Authentication.

This concept is HUGE. People spend their entire careers hovering around this single ideal. Auth ties in the principles of **Server Sessions Password Encryption/Hashing Security Risks JSON Web Tokens** and the use of different types of **Middlewares** and many other ideas. And what we are able to tackle here in the “Web” portion of the Lambda School Computer Science Academy portion will pale in comparison to what you can learn further on your own. And don’t worry, we talk more about this when you get to the 2nd half of the course.

## Introduction to Authentication
Authentication is a complex and important topic. Complex because new threats surface every day that challenge our security strategies and standards. It is important because most of our lives depend on online services and computer systems that hold our sensitive data.

In this module we’ll get a gentle introduction into the world of authentication, what it is and isn’t, as well as some strategies to protect the keys to our data: our credentials.

**Objectives:**

- Explain what is authentication and provide guidelines for password security.
- Hash passwords before saving them to the database
- Verify passwords using bcrypt
- Use in-memory sessions to persist authentication information across requests
- Implement logout using a sessions based API
- Restrict access to resources, allowing access only for authenticated users Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Build a full stack (an Express API and a React web application) authentication workflow using JSON Web Tokens.**

**Objectives:**

- Explain the three different parts of a JSON web token
- Produce and send a JSON Web Token (JWT)
- WEB Unit Testing
- **Learn what a unit test is, and how to write them using Jest.**

**Objectives:**

- Configure tools for adding automated tests to a JS project
- Use Jest to write unit tests
- Use Test Driven Development
- Testing the Back End
- **Learn how to add automated tests to an API.**

**Objectives:**

- Test Web API Endpoints
- Test Data Access Code
